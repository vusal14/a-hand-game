# game (a hand game)
It is a hand game, usually play between two people, in which each player simultaneously indicates a number 1-5 with their finger. The beginning of the game the players make a deal about how they start to count. There are two choices; starting from a small number or starting from a high number. Both of their numbers add up and start to count from one to the end of the number between both of them. On which player the last number stops, it shows the winner.

For instance,
Rule: game starts from a small number.
Player1 chooses 4 and Player2 chooses 5. (4+5=9) We start from Player1, because he chooses a small number. If we count from 1 to 9 between Player1 and Player2, we see that Player1 wins.

Rule: game starts from a high number.
Player1 chooses 4 and Player2 chooses 5. (4+5=9) We start from Player2, because he chooses a high number. If we count from 1 to 9 between Player2 and Player1, we see that Player2 wins.
